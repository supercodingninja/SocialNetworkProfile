	        <p>I am an American male, in the Greater Seattle area, whose in his mid 30's.  I like what William W. Purkey stated,
	        <br>
                <br><em>“You’ve gotta dance like there’s nobody watching,
Love like you’ll never be hurt,
Sing like there’s nobody listening,
And live like it’s heaven on earth.”</em></br>
                <br>
                <br>"<strong><u>Game-plan</u></strong>:" Clear, Focused, Thorough: <em>"<b>G</b>ather the facts, <b>A</b>nalyze the facts, <b>M</b>ake a plan; and <b>E</b>xecute it triumphantly- THAT'S HOW YOU WIN A <strong>G.A.M.E</strong>!"</em>- Frederick D. Thomas, Sr.</br>
                <br>
                <br><strong>Winning</strong> is a choice, as much as having a positive mental attitude: if I choose to win, succeed, and be happy; then, and only then, will I arise to peaks, yet climbed, venture worlds unknown; and see THE LIFE, Who is worth living for: but I must not quit, in order to live, and live, again! I love to win; but I love to win people!</br>
                <br>
                <br><strong><u>I never quit</u></strong>: I don't know how to. I learn how to win everyday- the other team may score a few points; but I know how to win, and win victoriously: violently and relentlessly removing all obstacles, in order to defeat the foe(s), take the prey; and return to camp, with rewards! This is why I will <em>“never give up on a dream, just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.”</em> -Earl Nightingale</br>
